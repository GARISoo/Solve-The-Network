# Evolution Gaming recruitment hometask - Pipes

<b><i>Hosted on netfily - https://evopipenetwork.netlify.app/</i></b>

<b>Description</b>
<p>
  Main task seems to be completed, you can rotate pipes manually, aswell added some additional actions. 
  Possible to submit and check your solution of the pipe network.
  Added some style to the components for UI experience.
  Not sure how to handle the huge pipe amount on level 4, 5, 6.
  The levels that are above level 3 take quite alot of time to render, added lock toggle and visual toggle, that might help with rendering higher levels.
  Few tests made with jest for key functions.

<b>Notes:</b>
<p>
  First time using websockets, not quite sure if been applied properly. The main task was built just in short amount of time, but
  then tried to implement the autosolver. Autosolver took me alot of time to figure out, wrote many functions to check surrounding pipes etc.
  At the end just could not figure out how to write a correct algorithm for walking between cells, tried implementing the A* then DFS, but no success 
  (never done this before).
